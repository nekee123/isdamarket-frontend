# White Screen Fix - IsdaMarket Frontend

## Problem
When deployed to production, the app showed a white screen when clicking on:
- Browse Fish
- My Orders  
- Account Settings

## Root Causes
1. **Missing/Incorrect API URL in production** - The app was trying to connect to `localhost:8000` in production
2. **No error boundaries** - JavaScript errors caused complete white screens with no feedback
3. **Inconsistent API URL handling** - Each file had its own `BASE_URL` definition

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Centralized API Configuration
**File:** `src/config/api.js`
- Created a centralized API configuration file
- Implements smart fallback logic:
  - First tries `REACT_APP_API_URL` from environment
  - Falls back to production URL if in production mode
  - Falls back to localhost for development
- Provides helper function for API calls with error handling

### 2. Error Boundary Component
**File:** `src/components/ErrorBoundary.js`
- Catches JavaScript errors anywhere in the component tree
- Displays user-friendly error message instead of white screen
- Shows error details for debugging
- Provides "Refresh Page" button for recovery
- Wrapped entire app in `App.js`

### 3. Updated All API References
Updated the following files to use centralized `BASE_URL`:
- **Pages:** BrowseFish, MyOrders, BuyerSettings, BuyerDashboard, BuyerLogin, SellerLogin, SellerOrders, SellerProducts, SellerProfile, SellerSettings, ViewProduct, ViewProfile
- **Components:** NotificationDropdown, SearchBar
- **Services:** api.js, messageApi.js

### 4. Environment Configuration
**Files:** `.env` and `.env.production`
- `.env` - Development: `http://localhost:8000`
- `.env.production` - Production: `https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com`

## How to Deploy

1. **Build the app:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the build folder** to your hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

3. **Set environment variable** (if supported by your host):
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com
   ```

## Testing Locally

1. **Test production build locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npx serve -s build
   ```

2. **Navigate to:**
   - Browse Fish page
   - My Orders page
   - Account Settings page

3. **Verify:**
   - No white screens
   - API calls work correctly
   - Error messages display if API is down

## What Changed

### Before
```javascript
const BASE_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || "http://localhost:8000";
```
- Each file had its own definition
- No fallback for production
- No error handling

### After
```javascript
import { BASE_URL } from "../config/api";
```
- Single source of truth
- Smart environment detection
- Proper fallbacks
- Error logging

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No more white screens** - Error boundary catches all errors
2. ✅ **Proper API URL in production** - Centralized configuration
3. ✅ **Better debugging** - Console logs show which API URL is being used
4. ✅ **Easier maintenance** - Change API URL in one place
5. ✅ **Better user experience** - Friendly error messages

## Future Improvements

- Add retry logic for failed API calls
- Implement service worker for offline support
- Add loading states for better UX
- Consider using React Query for API state management
