## 🔍 What I Fixed

1. ✅ Created `.env.production` with API URL
2. ✅ Updated `render.yaml` with better caching
3. ✅ Added error handler in `index.html` for chunk loading failures
4. ✅ Added `build:windows` command for easier building

## 🧪 Quick Test Commands

**Build locally:**
```bash
npm run build:windows
```

**Test locally before deploying:**
```bash
npx serve -s build -p 3000
```
Then visit http://localhost:3000 and test refreshing on different pages.

## 🆘 If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check Render Dashboard:
1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click your frontend service
3. Check "Events" tab - is deployment successful?
4. Check "Logs" tab - any errors?

### Clear Browser Cache:
```
Ctrl + Shift + Delete → Clear cached images and files
```

### Hard Refresh:
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### Check What's Deployed:
- Your frontend URL: Check Render dashboard for the URL
- Your backend URL: `https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com`

---

## 📞 What's Your Frontend URL?

Check your Render dashboard to find your frontend URL. It should be something like:
- `https://isdamarket-frontend.onrender.com`
- `https://your-app-name.onrender.com`

Once you have it, test these URLs:
1. `https://your-url.onrender.com/`
2. `https://your-url.onrender.com/buyer-dashboard`
3. Refresh on each page

All should work without white screen! ✨
