# Mobile Connection Issue - Fixed

## Problem
Mobile users couldn't sign up OR login because the app was trying to connect to `localhost:8000`, which doesn't work on mobile devices.

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Fixed hardcoded `localhost` URL in `src/services/api.js`
2. ✅ Fixed hardcoded URLs in `src/pages/ViewProfile.js`
3. ✅ Fixed hardcoded URLs in `src/pages/ViewProduct.js`
4. ✅ Fixed hardcoded URLs in `src/components/SearchBar.js`
5. ✅ Created `.env.production` file for production environment

**All API calls now use the environment variable** so they'll work on mobile devices once deployed.

## What You Need To Do

### Step 1: Update Production Environment Variable
Edit `.env.production` and replace the placeholder with your **actual backend API URL**:

```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-actual-backend-url.com
```

**Examples:**
- If using Render: `https://isdamarket-backend.onrender.com`
- If using Railway: `https://isdamarket-backend.up.railway.app`
- If using your own domain: `https://api.isdamarket.com`

### Step 2: Rebuild Your App
After updating `.env.production`, rebuild your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Redeploy
Deploy the new `build` folder to your hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## How to Find Your Backend URL

1. **Check your backend deployment platform** (Render, Railway, Heroku, etc.)
2. Look for the **public URL** or **domain** assigned to your backend
3. Make sure it starts with `https://` (not `http://`)
4. **Test it** by visiting `https://your-backend-url.com/docs` in a browser - you should see the FastAPI documentation

## Testing After Deployment

1. Open your deployed site on your **mobile phone**
2. Try to sign up as a buyer or seller
3. It should now connect successfully!

## Important Notes

- ⚠️ Make sure your backend allows CORS from your frontend domain
- ⚠️ Your backend must be deployed and running for the frontend to work
- ⚠️ Use HTTPS (not HTTP) for production
- ⚠️ After changing `.env.production`, you MUST rebuild and redeploy

## Still Having Issues?

Check:
1. Is your backend actually running and accessible?
2. Does your backend URL work when you visit it in a browser?
3. Are there any CORS errors in the browser console (F12)?
4. Did you rebuild the app after changing `.env.production`?
