# Deployment & Testing Guide

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. **Verify Environment Configuration**

Your app is configured to automatically use the correct backend URL:

- **Production**: `https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com` (automatic)
- **Development**: `http://localhost:8000` (automatic)

**Optional:** Set environment variable in Render dashboard:
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com
```

### 2. **Build and Deploy**

```bash
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add caching, optimize performance, fix dashboard stats"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Deploy to production

### 3. **Monitor Build Logs**

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select `isdamarket-frontend` service
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Watch for:
   - ‚úÖ "Build succeeded"
   - ‚úÖ "Deploy succeeded"
   - ‚ùå Any errors

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard shows all zeros

**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend is down
2. No data in database
3. API endpoint mismatch

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// Check console for API URL
console.log('API URL:', BASE_URL);

// Check network tab in DevTools
// Look for failed requests to /orders/ or /products/

// Verify backend is running
// Visit: https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com/docs
```

### Issue: "Failed to load products"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend cold start (first request after 15 min)
2. CORS error
3. Network timeout

**Solutions:**
1. Wait 60 seconds and try again
2. Check browser console for CORS errors
3. Verify backend is accessible:
   ```bash
   curl https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com/products/
   ```

### Issue: Slow page loads

**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend cold start
2. Large images
3. Too many API calls

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for backend to warm up
2. Check cache is working (console logs)
3. Verify parallel requests in Network tab

### Issue: Cache not working

**Check:**
```javascript
// Open browser console
// Navigate to Browse Fish
// Should see: "Using cached products"

// If you see "Fetching fresh products from API" every time:
// 1. Check cache duration (5 minutes)
// 2. Verify no errors during fetch
// 3. Check browser isn't in incognito mode
```

### Issue: Stats not updating

**Solutions:**
```javascript
// Manually clear cache
import { clearCache } from './services/api';
clearCache();

// Or wait 5 minutes for cache to expire
```

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Check API Response Times

Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab:

1. Filter by "Fetch/XHR"
2. Look for requests to `/products/`, `/orders/`
3. Check timing:
   - **First request**: 500ms - 2s (acceptable)
   - **Cached request**: 0-50ms (excellent)
   - **Cold start**: 30-60s (expected on free tier)

### Check Bundle Size

```bash
npm run build

# Check build/static/js/*.js file sizes
# Main bundle should be < 500KB
```

### Check Lighthouse Score

1. Open DevTools ‚Üí Lighthouse
2. Run audit
3. Target scores:
   - Performance: > 80
   - Accessibility: > 90
   - Best Practices: > 90
   - SEO: > 80

## üîç Debugging Tools

### Console Logs

The app logs important events:

```javascript
// API URL being used
"Using API URL from environment: https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com"

// Cache hits
"Using cached products"
"Using cached buyer orders"

// Fresh fetches
"Fetching fresh products from API"
"Fetching buyer orders from API"

// Cache invalidation
"Cache cleared"
```

### Network Tab

Monitor API calls:
- Green (200): Success
- Yellow (304): Cached by browser
- Red (404/500): Error
- Pending: Waiting for response

### React DevTools

Install React DevTools extension:
1. Check component re-renders
2. Inspect props and state
3. Profile performance
