## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Dashboard still shows zeros

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify backend is running: `https://isdamarket-3.onrender.com/docs`
3. Check if seller has products/orders in database
4. Clear cache: Open console → Type `clearCache()` → Press Enter

### Issue: Slow loading

**Solution:**
1. First load after 15 min is slow (Render cold start) - This is normal
2. Wait 60 seconds for backend to wake up
3. Subsequent loads should be fast

### Issue: Routes show 404

**Solution:**
1. Check `public/_redirects` file exists
2. Should contain: `/*    /index.html   200`
3. Redeploy if needed
