# Build Fix - React Hook Violation

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Error:**
```
Line 141:26: React Hook "useCallback" is called conditionally. 
React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render.
```

**Location:** `src/pages/BrowseFish.js`

---

## ✅ Solution

### Problem
The `useCallback` hook was being called inside JSX (conditionally):

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Hook called conditionally
{searchQuery && (
  <button onClick={useCallback(() => {
    setSearchQuery('');
    setFilteredProducts(products);
    groupProductsBySeller(products);
  }, [products, groupProductsBySeller])}>
    Clear search
  </button>
)}
```

### Fix
Moved the callback to the top level of the component:

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Hook at top level
const handleClearSearch = useCallback(() => {
  setSearchQuery('');
  setFilteredProducts(products);
  groupProductsBySeller(products);
}, [products, groupProductsBySeller]);

// Then use it in JSX
{searchQuery && (
  <button onClick={handleClearSearch}>
    Clear search
  </button>
)}
```

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **src/pages/BrowseFish.js**
- ✅ Added `handleClearSearch` as a proper `useCallback` hook at component top level
- ✅ Replaced inline `useCallback` in JSX with `handleClearSearch` reference
- ✅ All hooks now follow React's Rules of Hooks

### 2. **src/pages/SellerDashboard.js**
- ✅ Removed unused `FiTrendingUp` import

## 🧪 Build Verification

**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESS

```bash
npm run build
# Exit code: 0
# The build folder is ready to be deployed.
```

**Bundle Sizes:**
- Main bundle: 78.74 kB (gzipped)
- Total chunks: 28 files
- All optimized for production

**Warnings:** 
- Some ESLint warnings remain (unused variables in other files)
- These are non-blocking and won't prevent deployment
- Can be cleaned up in future updates

## 🎯 React Hooks Rules Compliance

All hooks in BrowseFish.js now follow the Rules of Hooks:

1. ✅ **useState** - Called at top level
2. ✅ **useEffect** - Called at top level
3. ✅ **useCallback** (all instances) - Called at top level
4. ✅ **useMemo** - Called at top level (imported but not used)
5. ✅ **useAuth** - Called at top level
6. ✅ **useToast** - Called at top level
7. ✅ **useNavigate** - Called at top level

**No conditional hook calls** ✅

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

The build now passes successfully and is ready for Render deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Move useCallback to top level to comply with React Hooks rules"
git push origin main
```

Render will automatically:
1. Detect the push
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build` ✅ (will succeed)
4. Deploy to production
