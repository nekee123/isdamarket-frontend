# White Screen on Refresh - Fix Documentation

## Problem
When refreshing the page on any route (e.g., `/buyer-dashboard`, `/seller-dashboard`), the app shows a white screen instead of loading the page.

## Root Cause
This is a common issue with Single Page Applications (SPAs) using client-side routing:
1. When you navigate within the app, React Router handles routing on the client side
2. When you refresh or directly access a URL, the server tries to find that exact file
3. Since routes like `/buyer-dashboard` don't exist as actual files, the server returns 404
4. This causes a white screen or "Cannot GET /route" error

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **404.html Redirect** (`public/404.html`)
- Created a 404.html file that redirects to index.html
- Uses a script to preserve the URL path during redirect
- Ensures the SPA can handle routing after redirect

### 2. **SPA Redirect Script** (`public/index.html`)
- Added script to handle query string conversion back to proper paths
- Works in conjunction with 404.html for seamless routing
- Placed before the app loads to ensure proper URL handling

### 3. **Render.yaml Configuration** (`render.yaml`)
- Configured proper rewrite rules for static assets
- Added catch-all route that serves index.html for all paths
- Ensures server-side routing fallback to client-side routing

### 4. **App.js Improvements** (`src/App.js`)
- Added useEffect hook to clear stale session storage
- Enhanced logging for debugging routing issues
- Ensures clean state on app mount

### 5. **Existing Safeguards**
- **lazyWithRetry**: Already handles chunk loading failures with retry logic
- **ErrorBoundary**: Catches and handles runtime errors gracefully
- **_redirects file**: Netlify-style redirects for additional hosting compatibility

## How It Works

### Flow on Page Refresh:
1. User refreshes on `/buyer-dashboard`
2. Server receives request for `/buyer-dashboard`
3. Render.yaml catch-all rule rewrites to `/index.html`
4. index.html loads with SPA redirect script
5. Script preserves the URL path
6. React app loads and Router handles `/buyer-dashboard`
7. Correct component renders

### Flow on Direct URL Access:
1. User types `yoursite.com/seller-dashboard` in browser
2. Same flow as refresh (steps 2-7 above)

## Testing

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Build the app
npm run build

# Serve the build folder
npx serve -s build

# Test these URLs:
# - http://localhost:3000/
# - http://localhost:3000/buyer-dashboard
# - http://localhost:3000/seller-dashboard
# - Refresh on any route
```

### Production Testing (Render):
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Render will auto-deploy
3. Test direct URL access: `https://yourapp.onrender.com/buyer-dashboard`
4. Test refresh on various routes
5. Check browser console for any errors

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `public/404.html` - Created
2. ✅ `public/index.html` - Added SPA redirect script
3. ✅ `render.yaml` - Updated routing configuration
4. ✅ `src/App.js` - Added cleanup logic

## Additional Notes

### Cache Considerations:
- Clear browser cache if issues persist: `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Render's cache headers are already configured properly

### Browser Compatibility:
- Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses standard JavaScript (no ES6+ features that need polyfills)

### Hosting Platform Compatibility:
- ✅ Render (primary deployment)
- ✅ Netlify (via _redirects file)
- ✅ Vercel (automatic SPA detection)
- ✅ GitHub Pages (via 404.html)
- ✅ Any static host with rewrite rules

## Troubleshooting

### If white screen still appears:

1. **Check Browser Console:**
   ```
   F12 → Console tab
   Look for errors related to:
   - Chunk loading failures
   - Network errors
   - JavaScript errors
   ```

2. **Verify Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   # Check build/index.html exists
   # Check build/static folder has JS/CSS files
   ```

3. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   npx serve -s build
   # Navigate to different routes
   # Refresh on each route
   ```

4. **Check Render Logs:**
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Check deployment logs for errors
   - Verify build completed successfully

5. **Clear All Caches:**
   ```javascript
   // Run in browser console
   sessionStorage.clear();
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload(true);
   ```

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Always test route refresh before deploying
2. Use the lazy loading with retry pattern for all route components
3. Keep ErrorBoundary wrapper around the entire app
4. Monitor Render deployment logs for warnings
5. Test on multiple browsers and devices

## Success Criteria

✅ App loads on direct URL access to any route
✅ App loads correctly on page refresh
✅ No white screen or 404 errors
✅ Browser console shows no errors
✅ All routes accessible via URL bar
✅ Navigation works smoothly
