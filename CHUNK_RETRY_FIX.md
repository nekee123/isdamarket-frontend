# ✅ Chunk Load Retry Logic - FIXED

## Problem Identified
The white screen issue on lazy-loaded routes was caused by **incorrect implementation** of the retry logic:

### ❌ Previous (Broken) Implementation:
```javascript
import { lazy } from 'react';
import { lazyRetry } from './utils/lazyRetry';

// WRONG: Double-wrapping lazy() around lazyRetry()
const BuyerLogin = lazy(() => lazyRetry(() => import('./pages/BuyerLogin')));
```

**Why it failed:**
- `lazy()` expects a function that returns a Promise
- `lazyRetry()` was being called inside another arrow function
- This created a double-wrapped structure that didn't properly handle chunk failures
- Chunks would fail silently, resulting in white screens

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Fixed `lazyRetry.js`** - Created proper `lazyWithRetry` wrapper
```javascript
import { lazy } from 'react';

const retryImport = (componentImport, retriesLeft = 3, interval = 1000) => {
  return componentImport().catch((error) => {
    if (retriesLeft === 0) {
      console.error('❌ Failed to load component after all retries:', error);
      throw error;
    }

    console.warn(`⚠️ Chunk load failed. Retrying... (${retriesLeft} attempts left)`);
    
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve(retryImport(componentImport, retriesLeft - 1, interval * 1.5));
      }, interval);
    });
  });
};

export const lazyWithRetry = (componentImport) => {
  return lazy(() => retryImport(componentImport));
};
```

### 2. **Updated `App.js`** - Correct usage pattern
```javascript
import { lazyWithRetry } from './utils/lazyRetry';

// CORRECT: lazyWithRetry handles both lazy() and retry logic
const BuyerLogin = lazyWithRetry(() => import('./pages/BuyerLogin'));
const SellerDashboard = lazyWithRetry(() => import('./pages/SellerDashboard'));
// ... all other lazy imports
```

## How It Works

1. **Initial Load Attempt**: When a route is accessed, React tries to load the chunk
2. **Automatic Retry on Failure**: If chunk fails to load:
   - Waits 1 second (exponential backoff: 1s → 1.5s → 2.25s)
   - Retries up to 3 times
   - Logs warnings in console for debugging
3. **Fallback**: Shows `<LoadingSpinner fullScreen={true} />` during retries
4. **Error Boundary**: If all retries fail, `ErrorBoundary` catches the error

## Build Results

✅ **New build generated**: `main.34df5d4b.js`
✅ **All 14 lazy-loaded pages** now have retry logic:
- HomePage, BuyerLogin, SellerLogin
- BuyerDashboard, SellerDashboard
- BuyerOrders, BrowseFish, BuyerSettings
- SellerProducts, SellerOrders, SellerSettings
- ViewProduct, ViewProfile, SellerProfile
- NotFound

---

## Testing Instructions

1. **Deploy the new build** to Netlify
2. **Test white screen scenarios**:
   - Navigate to `/buyer-login` and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Navigate to `/seller-dashboard` and hard refresh
   - Check browser console for retry messages
3. **Expected behavior**:
   - ✅ No white screen
   - ✅ Loading spinner shows during retries
   - ✅ Console shows: `⚠️ Chunk load failed. Retrying... (X attempts left)`
   - ✅ Page loads successfully after retry

## Key Differences

| Aspect | Before (Broken) | After (Fixed) |
|--------|----------------|---------------|
| **Pattern** | `lazy(() => lazyRetry(() => import()))` | `lazyWithRetry(() => import())` |
| **Retry Logic** | Not executed properly | Executes on chunk failures |
| **Console Logs** | Silent failures | Clear retry warnings |
| **White Screen** | ❌ Occurs frequently | ✅ Prevented by retries |
| **User Experience** | Broken | Seamless with loading spinner |

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/utils/lazyRetry.js` - Rewrote retry logic
2. ✅ `src/App.js` - Updated all 14 lazy imports

**No other files need changes** - the fix is complete and ready to deploy.
