# UI Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚úÖ ViewProfile Page Redesigned
**Problem:** Profile view was basic and didn't show contact information properly.

**Solution:**
- Modern card-based design with proper spacing
- Contact number now prominently displayed with icon
- Better organized information sections:
  - Profile picture/avatar at top
  - User name and type badge
  - Contact details (Location, Email, Contact Number) in separate cards
- Fully responsive design that works on both mobile and desktop
- Uses theme colors and modern UI components

### 2. ‚úÖ "Welcome back" Message
**Location:** Already present in BuyerDashboard (line 30) and SellerDashboard (line 19)

**Current Implementation:**
```javascript
// Buyer Dashboard
<h1 style={styles.title}>Welcome back, {buyerAuth.name}! üëã</h1>

// Seller Dashboard
<h1 style={styles.title}>Welcome back, {sellerAuth.name}! üê†</h1>
```

**Responsive Design:**
- Uses `clamp(2rem, 4vw, 3rem)` for font size
- Automatically adjusts for mobile and desktop screens
- Should be visible on all screen sizes

### 3. ‚úÖ Profile Picture Support
**Implementation:**
- If user has `profile_picture` field, it displays the image
- Falls back to avatar with first letter of name
- Proper error handling if image fails to load
- Circular design with shadow effects
