```
**Backend should:**
1. Update order status to "cancelled"
2. Create notification for buyer: `order_cancelled` type

## üîç Search Enhancement (Optional)

The frontend now handles search client-side, but you can optionally add server-side search:

```
GET /products/search?q={query}
GET /sellers/search?q={query}
```

---

## üìä Database Schema Suggestions

### Notifications Table
```
- uid (primary key)
- recipient_uid (indexed)
- recipient_type (buyer/seller)
- type (order_approved, new_order, new_review, etc.)
- message (text)
- read (boolean, default false)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

### Messages Table
```
- uid (primary key)
- sender_uid (indexed)
- sender_type (buyer/seller)
- recipient_uid (indexed)
- recipient_type (buyer/seller)
- message (text)
- created_at (timestamp)
```

**Indexes needed:**
- `(sender_uid, recipient_uid)` for fast message retrieval
- `(recipient_uid, created_at)` for notification queries
- `(recipient_uid, read)` for unread count queries

---

## üéØ Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority:**
   - Notifications API (all endpoints)
   - Review submission endpoint fix
   - Order status notification triggers

2. **Medium Priority:**
   - Messaging API (basic send/receive)
   - Conversation list endpoint (GET /messages/conversations/{user_uid})
   - Seller average rating calculation

3. **Low Priority:**
   - Server-side search
   - Message read receipts
   - Message editing/deletion
